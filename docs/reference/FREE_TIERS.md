# Free Tiers & Free-Token Budget

> **Last researched:** 2026-06-05 — per-provider web research of current free-tier quotas + ToS (98 providers).
> **Source of truth (catalog):** `src/shared/constants/providers.ts` (`hasFree: true` + `freeNote`). The token-budget numbers below come from live web research and are an **approximation** — see [Methodology & caveats](#methodology--caveats).

## TL;DR — how much free inference does OmniRoute actually aggregate?

| Metric | Tokens / month | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Documented recurring grant (steady)** | **~1.94B** | 50 provider free-tier **pools** (per-model catalog), each shared pool counted **once**. The live source behind `/api/free-tier/summary` and the dashboard's Free-Tier Budget page. **Use this number.** |
| **+ first month with signup credits** | **~2.53B** | Steady + one-time signup credits (DeepSeek 5M, Together, Jina, …), deduped per account. **First month only** — does not recur. |
| Theoretical ceiling (all rate limits, 24/7) | ~10.87B | Sum of every provider rate limit extrapolated to non-stop use. **Not a guarantee** — do not headline this. |

**Honest headline:** *OmniRoute aggregates **over 1.9B documented free tokens per month** (up to ~2.5B in your first month with signup credits) across 50+ free-tier pools — and RTK + Caveman compression (15–95% token savings) stretches that further.*

> The earlier **~1.54B** figure was a conservative per-PROVIDER estimate (22 hand-picked providers). The **~1.94B** above is the per-MODEL catalog (530 models / 50 pools, `open-sse/config/freeModelCatalog.ts`) — now the canonical source. Both use pool deduplication; the per-model catalog is simply more complete.

Biggest **documented** contributors: `mistral` 1.00B, `longcat` 150M, `cloudflare-ai` 122M, `gemini` 60M, `doubao` 60M, `cerebras` 30M.

> ⚠️ The theoretical ceiling (~10.87B) is inflated by rate-limit-only providers with **no published token cap** (`tencent`, `siliconflow`, `nvidia`, `baidu`, `publicai`, `sparkdesk`) whose figures are `RPM/TPM × 24/7 × 30d` — a theoretical maximum no single account will sustain. They are **excluded** from the defensible number. This is the same inflation that makes competitors' multi-billion claims unreliable.

---

## Methodology & caveats

- Numbers are **upper-bound estimates** from each provider's documented free-tier limits as of **2026-06-05**, gathered by web research (confidence tagged per row). Free tiers change constantly — re-verify before relying on a figure.
- `estMonthlyFreeTokens` = recurring monthly tokens only. **One-time signup credits do not recur** and count as 0 (29 providers are signup-credit-only). Discontinued tiers (6) are also 0.
- Daily token cap → `monthly = daily × 30`. Only RPD documented → `RPD × ~800 output tokens × 30`. Only RPM/TPM (no daily cap) → treated as **theoretical**, excluded from the defensible total.
- **A note on terms.** ~19 providers have personal-use or proxy clauses worth a glance before you lean on them (see the [provider-terms table](#tos-attention-table)). Their access is real — we simply don't fold the **un-quantifiable** OAuth/keyless ones (e.g. `gemini-cli`, `agy`, `amazon-q` — they share quota already counted under the base provider) into the headline. None of this is legal advice; you decide.

---

## ToS attention table

> A quick read on each provider's terms for a self-hosted, single-user personal proxy. `caution` = a personal-use or proxy clause worth checking; `ambiguous` = unclear; `ok` = explicitly permitted. Informational, not legal advice — you decide.

### ⚠️ Caution — personal-use / proxy clauses worth checking (19)

> Their free access is real and OmniRoute can route to them; the clauses below are just worth knowing. The OAuth/keyless ones aren't token-quantifiable, so they're not in the headline number (not because they're unusable).

## What changed since the shipped catalog (`freeNote`)

> The v3.8.0-era `freeNote` strings are stale. Corrections found by this research (these drive the catalog update in `_tasks/features-v3.8.12`):

- **`360ai`** — The shipped freeNote "Free 360 AI Brain models" appears outdated. Current access is application-gated and paid. The 2023 launch-era promotional tokens (100M–250M one-time) may have been the basis for…
- **`agentrouter`** — Our shipped freeNote says "$200 free credits on signup." Current reality shows standard (non-referral) signups receive only $100; referral signups may get $200 but a community comment from April 2026…
- **`agy`** — Our shipped freeNote says "(none)" implying no free tier, but Antigravity does have a free OAuth-gated tier. However, the ToS explicitly prohibits using this free tier through a proxy like OmniRoute …
- **`ai21`** — Tightened: trial window shrunk from "3 months" to 7 days. The $10 credit amount remains the same, but validity dropped sharply from ~90 days to 7 days.
- **`aimlapi`** — Changed significantly. Shipped freeNote advertised "$0.025/day free credits — 200+ models" but the free tier is now paused/discontinued. The $0.025/day credit allocation (50,000 credits/day, 10 req/d…
- **`amazon-q`** — Our shipped freeNote says "(none)" — the reality is worse: the product is now discontinued for new signups (May 15, 2026). Previously the free tier offered 50 agentic requests/month + unlimited inlin…
- **`api-airforce`** — Catalog ships freeNote "(none)" but a documented free tier exists: 1 RPM / 1,000 RPD recurring, account signup required, limited to basic models.
- **`arcee-ai`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free Trinity Large Thinking model (262K context)") is partially accurate — Trinity Large Thinking is indeed free via OpenRouter with 262K context — but the note omits that this…
- **`baichuan`** — Our shipped freeNote says "Free Baichuan models" which implies ongoing free access, but current reality is only a one-time 80 CNY trial credit for new users (valid 3 months). There are no permanently…
- **`baidu`** — The catalog says "Free ERNIE Speed/Lite models" which is broadly accurate, but understates the scope: ERNIE-Tiny and multiple context-window variants (8K and 128K) are also free. The free tier appear…
- **`bazaarlink`** — Broadly matches — the shipped freeNote accurately describes auto:free routing for zero-cost inference. However, the current reality includes explicit rate limits (10-20 RPM, ~150 RPD) not mentioned i…
- **`blackbox`** — Our shipped freeNote claims "unlimited basic chat plus Minimax-M2.5." In reality, unlimited Minimax-M2.5 agent requests are a paid-plan feature (Pro+), not part of the free tier. The free tier has li…
- **`bluesminds`** — Our shipped freeNote was "(none)" — but BluesMinds does have a documented free tier: 500 pi credits, 20 RPM, 300 RPD, permanent free plan. The catalog significantly understates the offering.
- **`brave-search`** — The catalog notes "(none)" suggesting no free tier was tracked, but in reality there was a free 5,000 queries/month tier (no card) until February 12, 2026, which has since been replaced by a $5/month…
- **`byteplus`** — Our catalog shipped "(none)" but BytePlus ModelArk does have a free tier: a one-time trial credit of 500k tokens per LLM model for new accounts. The catalog underreports this.
- **`cerebras`** — TPM appears tightened from 60K to 30K on current documented models (gpt-oss-120b, zai-glm-4.7). RPM of 5 is now explicitly documented (was not in our shipped note). Daily token cap of 1M/day is uncha…
- **`chutes`** — The shipped freeNote says "Free tier available" but as of March 15, 2026, the free tier has been officially discontinued. The catalog note is stale and should be updated to reflect that there is no r…
- **`completions`** — Our shipped freeNote ("Free unlimited access to Claude, GPT, Gemini — no rate limits") still matches the site's self-described claims. However, the service is a legally dubious, short-lived aggregato…
- **`coze`** — The shipped note "Free ByteDance agent platform" is directionally accurate but omits that the free tier is now tightly credit-capped (10 credits/day ≈ 5–100 messages depending on model), a constraint…
- **`deepinfra`** — Our shipped freeNote says "Free signup credits for API testing" — this appears stale. The official pricing page now requires card/prepayment with no documented general free signup credit. The free ti…
- **`deepseek`** — Our shipped note says "5M free tokens on signup - no credit card required" — this is still accurate for the one-time grant, but importantly the credits expire after 30 days (not mentioned in the ship…
- **`dify`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free open-source AI app builder + RAG") is directionally accurate but incomplete. The cloud free tier is more constrained than implied: 200 message credits appear to be a one-t…
- **`doubao`** — The shipped freeNote "Free Doubao models (ByteDance)" is directionally correct but underspecified. Current reality is more structured: there is a quantified recurring daily free tier (2M tokens/day v…
- **`duckduckgo-web`** — The core "free anonymous access" description still holds, but the service has matured significantly: it now has explicit paid tiers (Plus/Pro) with higher limits implying the free tier is rate-constr…
- **`exa-search`** — Catalog ships freeNote "(none)" but Exa has a documented recurring free tier of 1,000 requests/month. This is a significant gap — the free tier exists and is permanent.
- **`featherless-ai`** — Our shipped freeNote says "Free tier available" but there is no general free tier. The only free access is through an invitation/application-based Builder Series program, which is not a standard free…
- **`firecrawl`** — Our catalog shipped freeNote "(none)", implying no free tier. In reality Firecrawl has a documented recurring free plan with 1,000 credits/month — the catalog entry is incorrect.
- **`freemodel-dev`** — Our shipped freeNote is "(none)" — this was likely a placeholder meaning the provider was not yet cataloged. In reality the provider does have a $300 one-time trial credit offer. However, this is a o…
- **`friendliai`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free tier for serverless inference") is partially accurate but misleading. There is free access via Tier 0 and free-designated models, but the rate limits are undefined and ada…
- **`gemini`** — The shipped freeNote says "1,500 req/day for Gemini 2.5 Flash" — this was accurate before December 2025. Google cut free-tier limits by 50-80% in December 2025, reducing Gemini 2.5 Flash from 1,500 R…
- **`gemini-cli`** — Catalog ships "(none)" implying no free tier was recognized. In reality, Gemini CLI did have a notable free OAuth tier (1,000 RPD via Google Account) until recently, but it is now being shut down (Ju…
- **`github-models`** — Catalog note "Free GPT-5, o-series, DeepSeek-R1, Llama 4, Grok 3" is directionally correct about model availability but omits the daily rate limits (50 RPD for high-tier models, 150 RPD for low-tier)…
- **`gitlawb`** — The shipped freeNote "Free tier available" is effectively stale. The original free MiMo access was removed in May 2026; the only remaining "free" option is a temporary promotional model (Nemotron 3 U…
- **`gitlawb-gmi`** — Partially still accurate — free tier exists but is now narrowed to a single model (Nemotron 3 Ultra) after MiMo free access was revoked in late May 2026. The shipped note "Free tier available" unders…
- **`glhf`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free tier for open-source model inference") is now stale. The free beta ended in January 2025; GLHF Chat is now a paid pay-as-you-go service. There is no ongoing recurring free…
- **`groq`** — The shipped freeNote "30 RPM / 14.4K RPD" is accurate only for llama-3.1-8b-instant. Most other models (including llama-3.3-70b-versatile) have a much lower 1K RPD cap. The note omits model-specific …
- **`hackclub`** — The "30+ models" count appears accurate and still matches. The core offering remains free for Hack Club members. No evidence of tightening — still "$0 ALWAYS FREE" per the homepage. The freeNote omit…
- **`huggingchat`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free LLM chat — no subscription required. Rate limits apply.") is partially accurate but significantly understates the restrictions. The free tier now operates on a hard $0.10/…
- **`huggingface`** — Significantly tightened. The shipped freeNote ("Free Inference API for thousands of models") implied unlimited/generous free access, but as of mid-2025 the free tier is capped at $0.10/month in recur…
- **`hyperbolic`** — Our shipped freeNote says "$1-5 trial credits on signup" — the $1 trial credit portion is accurate, but the "$5" figure refers to the minimum deposit required to unlock GPU rental (not free credits g…
- **`iflytek`** — Catalog says "Free Spark Lite models" — this is broadly accurate. However the current reality is more nuanced: only Spark Lite is free (the Max 100M token offer was a one-time promo, not recurring); …
- **`inclusionai`** — Our shipped freeNote says "Free Ling-2.6-flash model (262K context)" without specifying token limits. Reality is more specific: the free tier is 500K tokens/day (shared across all models), with a 2 Q…
- **`inference-net`** — The shipped freeNote states "$25 free credits on signup plus research grants." The current pricing page shows only $1 recurring monthly credits with no mention of a $25 signup bonus or research grant…
- **`jina-reader`** — Our shipped freeNote was "(none)", which is incorrect. Jina Reader has had a publicly documented free tier since launch: keyless access at 20 RPM plus a 10M one-time token grant with a free API key. …
- **`kiro`** — Catalog shipped freeNote "(none)" — but Kiro has a documented, perpetual free tier of 50 credits/month. The free tier existed since Kiro's public launch (pricing formalized ~October 2025). This is a …
- **`kluster`** — The $5 free credits on signup appears to still match. However, there is evidence of an additional permanent free tier (post-credit) with undocumented limits, which may represent an improvement over t…
- **`llm7`** — Rate limits have increased from the shipped freeNote (20 RPM / 100 req/hr → 40 RPM / 200 req/hr). The "no signup required" claim is now outdated — a free token from token.llm7.io is now required (tho…
- **`longcat`** — Significant change from shipped freeNote of "(none)": the platform actively provides 5M free tokens/day on a recurring daily basis to all API users during the public beta.
- **`mistral`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free Experiment tier: rate-limited access to all models") is directionally correct but understated. Current reality adds specific documented limits: 2 RPM, 500K TPM, 1B tokens/…
- **`monsterapi`** — The shipped freeNote says "Free credits for decentralized GPU inference" which is partially accurate — there are one-time trial credits on signup. However, the recurring free tier has 0 credits/month…
- **`morph`** — The shipped freeNote mentions "250K credits/month" which matches the current credit allocation; however, the more significant constraint is 200 requests/month which was not captured in the original c…
- **`muse-spark-web`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free with login — Meta AI platform with Llama models") is broadly accurate regarding login requirement and Llama model access. No tightening of the free tier was detected; it r…
- **`nlpcloud`** — The shipped freeNote says "Trial credits for new accounts," which implies a one-time trial. In reality, NLP Cloud's free tier is a recurring monthly free plan (10,000 requests/month), not trial credi…
- **`nomic`** — Our shipped freeNote says "Free Nomic Embed API" with no qualification, implying ongoing free access. Reality is a one-time 1M-token trial credit only — after that token budget is consumed, paid subs…
- **`nous-research`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free tier: 50 RPM, 500,000 TPM") does not match the current Nous Portal product. The portal launched April 27, 2026 and structures its free tier as $0.10/month in recurring cre…
- **`nvidia`** — The "40 RPM, 70+ models" rate limit element matches the catalog, but the freeNote framing as a simple dev-access tier undersells that the old one-time credit pool has been removed — access is now tru…
- **`ollama-cloud`** — Our shipped freeNote is "(none)" — this is stale. Ollama Cloud launched a cloud inference product with a genuine free tier that provides light weekly GPU-time-based access to hosted open models.
- **`openrouter`** — RPD tightened from 200 to 50 for zero-credit accounts (RPM unchanged at 20). The catalog note was accurate on RPM but overstated the RPD by 4x for the no-credits baseline tier.
- **`phind`** — Our shipped freeNote describes an active free chat/code-search service — but Phind is fully discontinued as of January 16, 2026. The catalog entry should be marked discontinued and removed from activ…
- **`pollinations`** — Partially matches — the "no API key required" claim is still true for anonymous access, but the catalog freeNote omits that: (1) rate limits do apply (interval throttle of ~1 req/6-15s for anonymous …
- **`predibase`** — The shipped freeNote ($25 free trial credits, 30-day validity) still matches current documentation. However, the catalog omits the concurrent 20,000 tokens/day serverless rate limit that applies duri…
- **`publicai`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free community inference tier") is broadly accurate but understates the specificity: the 20 RPM rate limit is now documented. No major tightening found; the service remains fre…
- **`puter`** — Partially matches: the "500+ models" count is still accurate. However "users pay via Puter account" understates the reality — free accounts receive an undocumented starting credit that can be exhaust…
- **`qoder`** — Our catalog ships freeNote "(none)", but Qoder does have a free tier: a Community Edition with unlimited basic-model completions (daily-capped, unspecified limit) plus a one-time 14-day/300-credit Pr…
- **`qwen-web`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free — Qwen models via chat.qwen.ai with login token") is now stale. The login-token/OAuth free API path was terminated on 2026-04-15. The qwen-web executor will receive 401 er…
- **`sambanova`** — Our shipped note only described the one-time $5 credit (30-day validity). The current reality includes a permanent recurring free tier with documented rate limits (20 RPM, 20 RPD, 200k TPD) that pers…
- **`sensenova`** — Our shipped freeNote says "Free SenseTime models" which is vague but directionally correct — free access does exist. However, reality is more nuanced: free access is a time-limited public beta (Token…
- **`serper-search`** — The shipped freeNote says "(none)" which is partially accurate — there is no recurring free plan — but Serper does offer 2,500 one-time trial credits on signup. The catalog note could be more precise…
- **`siliconflow`** — Partially matches but more nuanced: the $1 free credits are a one-time trial (not recurring), while the "permanently free models" component still holds — free $0 models continue to exist (Qwen3-8B, D…
- **`sparkdesk`** — Partially matches — the shipped freeNote "Free iFlytek Spark models" is accurate in that Spark Lite is permanently free, but understates the constraint (2 QPS per App ID) and overstates scope (only S…
- **`stepfun`** — The shipped freeNote "Free Step-2 models" is stale. Step-2 LLM free access is no longer offered; the platform has transitioned to Step 3.x models on a paid-per-token basis with no free LLM tier. Only…
- **`t3-web`** — The shipped freeNote is broadly accurate (limited model access, Pro unlocks 50+ models for $8/month), but misses two key updates: (1) the free tier now resets daily instead of monthly (changed around…
- **`tavily-search`** — Catalog ships freeNote "(none)" implying no free tier, but Tavily does in fact offer a documented recurring free tier of 1,000 credits/month with no credit card required. This is a significant discre…
- **`tencent`** — Largely matches — the shipped freeNote ("Free Hunyuan Lite models") is accurate. Hunyuan-lite has been permanently free since May 2024 and remains so as of 2026. The catalog note undersells the detai…
- **`theoldllm`** — Our shipped freeNote was "(none)" — this still matches in the sense that no structured API/free tier offering exists; the service remains a UI-only chat wrapper with no catalogable API tier.
- **`together`** — The shipped note says "$25 signup credits + 3 permanently free models" but reality shows far more permanently free models (~80, not 3). The $25 trial credit figure is contested — official billing doc…
- **`uncloseai`** — Largely matches — still free forever with no signup. However, the ToS (terms-of-use.html) clarifies IP-based throttling exists for excessive use and prohibits building competing ML services without a…
- **`veoaifree-web`** — The shipped freeNote states "6 requests/hour" but no such explicit limit is currently documented anywhere on veoaifree.com. The site claims unlimited free generation with no login. The models listed …
